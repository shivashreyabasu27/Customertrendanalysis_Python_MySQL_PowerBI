📊 Customer Behavior Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data extraction to business intelligence reporting. The goal was to analyze customer behavior and understand subscription patterns across demographics such as age and gender.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
Here’s a snapshot of the interactive dashboard built in Power BI:

![Customer_Trend_Analysis]()

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas) → Extracted data from a GitHub CSV URL, cleaned and transformed datasets.

SQLAlchemy + MySQL → Connected Python to MySQL, created tables, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries.

Power BI → Imported processed data to build interactive dashboards and visualize customer insights.

⚙️ Workflow
Data Extraction → Pulled raw CSV data directly from a GitHub URL.

Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python) → Handled missing values, standardized formats, and prepared features.

Database Integration (SQLAlchemy + MySQL) → Loaded cleaned data into MySQL for structured storage and SQL‑based analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL) → Queried customer purchase and subscription behavior.

Visualization (Power BI) → Built dashboards to highlight subscription trends by age, gender, and other customer attributes.

📊 Key Insights
Revenue and sales across age groups.

Gender differences in subscription behavior provide useful segmentation opportunities.

Identified top customer segments driving repeat subscriptions.
